My story: 
In a lively animal school, the tallest student in the class was a giraffe. At first, the giraffe was worried about not fitting in with everyone else because of being so tall and different. However, the classmates soon discovered that the giraffe's height was a real advantage. Thanks to the giraffe's ability to see from far away, they could always spot when the teacher was on the way. The giraffe often gave the class a heads-up, making everyone appreciate having such a helpful friend. Over time, the giraffe no longer felt out of place and realized that their unique trait made them an important part of the class.

Donna's story: 
Once upon a time, there was a nation called 'Supereasytocodewithp5'. The nation was populated with people who had appearances that were super easy to code with p5.js. This is one of the citizens, their name is Yebleen(Yellow+Blue+Green).

Nova's story:
Agijangsu Utu-ri is a figure from Korean mythology, known as a child born with extraordinary strength and dragon-like wings. These children, called Agijangsu, were believed to be born to save the country from great danger. However, fearing their power, kings and authorities would often attempt to eliminate them before they could grow and challenge the rulers. The story of Agijangsu Utu-ri reflects themes of fear, destiny, and the tragic fate of those born with exceptional abilities in a world unprepared for them.

3. A new background story you’re creating based on the collectively assembled information
In a vibrant world full of wonder, there lived a giraffe with an extraordinary gift for dancing. What made this giraffe unique was the ability to stretch and retract its long neck, moving with incredible grace and precision. During performances, the giraffe would glide effortlessly across the stage, bending and twisting its neck to fit into small spaces, like boxes, with perfect timing. The giraffe's true brilliance shone when the spotlight moved. Wherever the light traveled, the giraffe would follow, its movements synchronized perfectly with the shifting beams. The giraffe’s ability to adapt to the changing light turned every dance into a breathtaking display of movement and light, leaving audiences mesmerized by the elegance and creativity of the performance.


4. Your assignment reflections
This was a really interesting assignment, and I found myself particularly absorbed in drawing Nova’s pants. I spent a lot of time on this part, trying my best to recreate the texture and feel of the fabric as accurately as possible. The process was both challenging and rewarding as I worked through different ways to add folds and dimension to make the pants look realistic.
What I enjoyed the most was seeing how each new combination brought a fresh perspective to the overall design. Every time the different elements of the drawing came together in a new way, it added a layer of unpredictability and creativity, making the final outcome exciting and unique. This constant evolution of the piece through new combinations made the assignment not only fun but also a great learning experience.
