    <h1>Project 6: Data Portrait</h1>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p><strong>Personal Habit I Tracked:</strong><br>For this data portrait, I chose to track my sleep patterns over five consecutive days, focusing on three specific metrics: total sleep time, deep sleep duration, and my mental state upon waking (rated on a scale of 1-10).</p>
    <p><strong>Instruction:</strong><br>The flowers in my data portrait represent each day. Hereâ€™s how to interpret the visual:<br>
       Stem Height: The height of the flower's stem corresponds to the total hours of sleep I got each night.<br>
       Number of Petals: The more petals a flower has, the more deep sleep I experienced that night. Petals is based on my deep sleep duration.<br>
       Flower Color: The color of the flower is based on my mental state in the morning, transitioning from pink (high mental state) to purple (low mental state).</p>
    <p><strong>Data Collection:</strong><br>
    Saturday: Sleep Time: 10.83 hours, Deep Sleep: 6.28 hours, Mental State: 8<br>
    Sunday: Sleep Time: 6.23 hours, Deep Sleep: 3.3 hours, Mental State: 3<br>
    Monday: Sleep Time: 8.37 hours, Deep Sleep: 2.13 hours, Mental State: 6<br>
    Tuesday: Sleep Time: 7.05 hours, Deep Sleep: 1.62 hours, Mental State: 4<br>
    Wednesday: Sleep Time: 5.75 hours, Deep Sleep: 1.2 hours, Mental State: 1</p>
