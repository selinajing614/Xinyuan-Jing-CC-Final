Describe the process of researching, designing, and fine-tuning your optical illusion.
Researching and designing this optical illusion involved studying how our eyes and brain work together to perceive motion and color. I was inspired by rotating shapes and wave patterns that trick the brain into seeing movement where there is none. I wanted to create an illusion where rotating shapes, combined with shifting colors, could interact with a dynamic background. Using color gradients that change based on mouse movements, along with waves in the background, I created an illusion that feels alive and constantly in motion.

This optical illusion could be a useful tool for relaxation in various settings. It could be part of a browser extension, offering users a soothing, interactive background that shifts colors and patterns to help ease stress while working.In therapeutic settings, this illusion could serve as a tool for stress relief or meditation. The rotating shapes and soft, gradual color transitions could help individuals focus their attention and reduce anxiety.
