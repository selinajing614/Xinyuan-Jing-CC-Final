                        <p>Project Introduction: My final project explores the themes of determinism and fate through an interactive digital experience using TouchDesigner and Mediapipe. It features four 3D models—an hourglass, Möbius strip, spinning top, and meteorite—each symbolizing different beginnings tied to time and space. Users interact with these models through intuitive gestures such as swiping to switch models, creating waves, or breaking apart the shapes, but despite their actions, all interactions converge to the same inevitable outcome: a chaotic final form representing fate. The project combines visual storytelling, gesture-based interaction, and auditory elements to create an immersive exploration of the philosophical tension between perceived control and preordained results, inviting users to reflect on the inevitability of outcomes in a constrained system.</p>
