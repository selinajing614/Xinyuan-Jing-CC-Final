Write a description for your experimental clock. How is it novel to you and how might it alter the way you track / keep time? 
My experimental clock serves as a metaphor for the fleeting nature of time, with a random shape appearing every second to symbolize the uniqueness of each moment. As the shapes gradually disappear after 10 seconds, they remind us of the impermanence of time and the importance of cherishing each second. The circular ring that follows the mouse's movement represents the time left until the completion of an hour, reinforcing the constant progression of time. Each mouse click changes the background color, symbolizing the ever-changing and unpredictable nature of life. The clock encourages mindfulness and positivity, urging us to embrace each moment and appreciate the journey, as every second brings a new and valuable experience.

Describe your design process. 
In designing the clock, I first used frameCount, drop, and random functions to create shapes that appear randomly on the screen every second. Next, I implemented a fading effect to gradually make these shapes disappear after 10 seconds, emphasizing the transient nature of each moment. Finally, I integrated the mouse's mouseX and mouseY coordinates to control the movement of a circular ring that tracks time, with mousePressed used to change the background color.

Whatâ€™s your overall reflection on this assignment? What have you learned throughout the process of designing an unconventional clock?
I found this project to be a fascinating challenge. Throughout the process, I conducted many tests make sure the final outcome was both visually engaging and meaningful. One of the key techniques I explored was the use of fading, which added a layer of depth to the experience by gradually erasing the shapes. Overall, the assignment encouraged me to think about time in a more abstract and artistic way, pushing me to experiment with interactive elements that evoke reflection on how we perceive and value each moment.
