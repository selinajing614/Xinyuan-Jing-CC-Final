            <p><strong>The language my partner used to describe the image:</strong></p>
            <p>My object is a pair of wireless earphones that are blueish grey in colour. They are from one plus company, the shape of the box is a rectangle but the edges are curved. The earphones are in a 'P' shape and the inside speaker area is dark grey. The logo of the company is at the bottom centre of the box.</p>

            <p><strong>My interpretation of the image:</strong></p>
            <p>I chose to draw the earpods and the earpod case separately because my partner described the shape of the earpods. I used a shape without strokes to make the picture appear more unified. Then, I used code to draw the earpods and the earpod case on the cat's paw because her earpods were hidden by the cat.</p>
