    <h1>Project 3: Experimental Clock</h1>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        My experimental clock serves as a metaphor for the fleeting nature of time, with a random shape appearing every second to symbolize the uniqueness of each moment. As the shapes gradually disappear after 10 seconds, they remind us of the impermanence of time and the importance of cherishing each second. The circular ring that follows the mouse's movement represents the time left until the completion of an hour, reinforcing the constant progression of time. Each mouse click changes the background color, symbolizing the ever-changing and unpredictable nature of life. The clock encourages mindfulness and positivity, urging us to embrace each moment and appreciate the journey, as every second brings a new and valuable experience.
